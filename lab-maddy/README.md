# Documentation:
  * What this API does:
   The goal of this project is to practice creating a single resource express API that can handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

   A few of us went back and worked on lab 9, by getting the majority of the tests working and then we copied that work into this lab.

  * We will work with application, router, and 3rd party middleware through the use of express.js.
  * We will be able to implement custom middleware through the use of express.js.
  * We will be able to create custom routers for a specific resource.

# Any resources that helped me complete this assignment:


# How another dev could 'get started' with my api on their own:
      - How do you clone this project?
      First fork from my repository, then clone from your repo, then create a branch.
      - How do you start using this project?
          1. You will need to have NodeJS installed on your machine.
          2. You will need to install httpie in one terminal window.
          3. Then start up nodemon in a separate terminal window.

HOW TO TEST POST IN TERMINAL:
- To get an object in terminal, paste this in terminal (with your server still running in another window). (we're able to do this with the http client- superagent to make request on the server side to test for objects like this one):

http POST :3000/api/toy name=barney desc='purple dino'

- Example responses:
* I realize the following is probably not what is being asked of me, but it's all I've got right now.
    - Then the following good request info is displayed in terminal:
    ```


    ```

HOW TO TEST GET IN TERMINAL (using the params method not the query method):

http GET :3000/api/toy/f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "_id": "f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21",
    "desc": "purple dino",
    "name": "barney"
}
```

HOW TO TEST A PUT IN TERMINAL:

http PUT :3000/api/toy/f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21 name=isaac desc=human _id=f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21_

```

HOW TO TEST DELETE IN TERMINAL: ????? Is the following the correct syntax?

http DELETE :3000/api/toy/f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21 name=isaac desc=human _id=f18a6d2b-753c-41f6-9c28-d2a7f0b41f21_

```

```
And then if I test a GET on this object to make sure it's destroyed:

```

```



# Packages and commands to remember:
  - In package.json's scripts, add- "start:debug": "DEBUG=http* nodemon server.js",
  - created an index.js and set it as the start point in package.json
  - deleted parse-url.json and ________
  - added a cors.js file

  - npm install express - DONE
  - npm install (for node modules) -
  - npm install httpie -
  - npm install superagent -
  - npm install uuid -
  - npm install -D jest -
    - npm test

  - node server.js or just nodemon (depending on the day??)
    - rs (restart, if needed)
  - run start: watch -
  - npm run start:debug - then attempt a POST and this will tell you where you're wrong

  - npm run debugger -
  - npm install bluebird (sets this as a dependency in package.json) -

  I added the following to my package.json scripts:
  "debugger": "node inspect server.js",

  I've added the server.js to the lib directory.

  Then in terminal, within the project directory, type:
  npm run debugger

    - You should then see:
    > node inspect server.js
